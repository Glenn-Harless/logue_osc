# FM Synthesis Theory for Metallic Sounds

## Why FM for Bells/Metallic Sounds?

FM synthesis excels at creating metallic timbres because:
1. It generates complex harmonic and inharmonic spectra efficiently
2. Real metallic objects have non-integer harmonic relationships
3. The modulation index controls brightness naturally
4. Decay characteristics match struck metal objects

## Key Ratios for Different Sounds

### Harmonic Ratios (Musical)
- 1:1 - Fundamental only
- 2:1 - Octave (hollow sound)
- 3:1 - Octave + fifth (clarinet-like)
- 4:1 - Two octaves (bright)

### Inharmonic Ratios (Metallic)
- 1.41:1 - Square root of 2 (tubular bells)
- 3.14:1 - Pi ratio (steel drums)
- 3.5:1 - Classic FM bell
- 7.1:1 - Kalimba/thumb piano
- 13:1 - Glass/crystal

## Modulation Index (I) Effects

I = (Δf × mod_depth) / fm

Where:
- Δf = frequency deviation
- fm = modulating frequency

### Low Index (I < 1)
- Few sidebands
- Warm, simple tones
- Good for soft bells

### Medium Index (1 < I < 5)
- Rich harmonic content
- Classic FM sounds
- Steel drums, marimbas

### High Index (I > 5)
- Many sidebands
- Bright, clangy
- Harsh metallic hits

## Envelope Relationships

### Classic Bell (Amp > Mod decay)
- Bright attack
- Mellows as it decays
- Natural bell behavior

### Reverse Bell (Mod > Amp decay)
- Starts mellow
- Gets brighter
- Unnatural but interesting

### Percussion (Very fast both)
- Sharp transient
- Quick decay
- Good for hits/clicks

## Special Techniques

### Double Carrier
- Use same modulator for two carriers
- Slight detune between carriers
- Creates chorus/ensemble effect

### Feedback FM
- Route carrier back to modulator
- Creates noise and chaos
- Good for cymbals/gongs

### Nested FM
- Modulator has its own modulator
- Very complex spectra
- Good for evolving sounds
